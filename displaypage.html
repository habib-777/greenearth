        <h1>10 Must-Read Environmental Books.</h1>
          <img src="images/en-3.avif" alt="Enviornment Image">
          <p>Our recommended list of environmental books covers a broad range of topics, from climate disinformation to individual initiatives that have led to global change. Spanning different genres and perspectives on conservation issues, these 10 must-read environmental books are sure to spark the interest of the greenest bookworms.</p>
          <h2>Braiding Sweetgrass</h2>
          <p>"Braiding Sweetgrass," by Indigenous author Robin Wall Kimmer, looks at the relationship between humans and the land. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, Kimmer ties lessons she learned from her culture and history to Western society's view of plants and aims to reveal the importance plants and animals have in our world.</p>
          <p>The book also explores the lessons we may learn from plants and animals and how they relate to certain stories, like the creation story. In doing so, Kimmer hopes to widen the reader's ecological consciousness. "Braiding Sweetgrass" won the 2014 Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award.</p>
          <h2>Merchants of Doubt</h2>
          <p>This non-fiction book by science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway explores the parallels between the global warming "controversy" and the "controversies" surrounding tobacco, acid rain, and DDT.</p>
          <p>"Merchants of Doubt" details how high-level scientists influenced by political connections ran disinformation campaigns against established science, delaying progress and policy implementation on those issues as well as global warming and the ozone hole. According to former Vice President Al Gore, “anyone concerned about the state of democracy in America should read this book."</p>
          <h2>The End of Nature</h2>
          <p>Published in 1989, "The End of Nature" describes the relationship between nature and humans. It expresses the idea that nature was previously independent of humans but has now been affected by them in every way. According to author Bill McKibben, the idea of wilderness is lost, and nature is no longer intact.</p>
          <p>The book focuses on the concepts of nature and wilderness and the value they have lost. McKibben argues that true change will require a fundamental shift in how we view and interact with nature.</p>
          <h2>Silent Spring</h2>
          <p>Written by Rachel Carson, "Silent Spring" has been described as a landmark work of environmental writing and is credited with bringing the environmental movement into mainstream focus.</p>
          <p>The book highlights the effects of pesticides on the environment, especially DDT, which was a very popular insecticide until it was finally banned in 1972. The book eventually led to a reversal in the United States’ pesticide policy and contributed to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
          <h2>The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History</h2>
          <p>"The Sixth Extinction," by Elizabeth Kolbert, describes previous mass extinction events and connects them to the many extinctions currently taking place.</p>
          <p>Kolbert studies the relationships humans have with the environment and finds that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, this one caused by humans. The book looks at studies and research covering things such as the disappearance of the Panamanian golden frog and the effect of ocean acidification on corals. "The Sixth Extinction" won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction and the 2015 Massachusetts Book Award (Non-Fiction).</p>
          <h2>The Uninhabitable Earth</h2>
          <p>This book by David Wallace Wells provides a detailed look at how we treat the Earth and how our actions will affect us and the planet's future.          </p>
          <p>"The Uninhabitable Earth" argues that current actions will not be enough to prevent the effects of climate change. The author examines the disasters that have already occurred and looks ahead to the year 2100 and what climate change will do if we continue on our current path. Its opening line is incredibly telling: "It is worse, much worse, than you think."</p>
